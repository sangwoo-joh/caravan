(** Actors and the operations they perform.

    Each actor runs as its own fiber, owns a private mailbox, and blocks in
    {!receive} until a matching message arrives. Every operation here performs an
    effect that {!Scheduler} interprets. *)

module Address : sig
  type 'msg t
  (** A shareable, send-only handle to an actor accepting ['msg]. *)

  val equal : 'a t -> 'b t -> bool
  val pp : Format.formatter -> 'a t -> unit
end

type 'msg self
(** An actor's receive capability, handed only to its body. Anyone holding an
    {!Address.t} can send to an actor; only the actor itself can read its
    mailbox. *)

type 'msg body = 'msg self -> unit
(** The code an actor runs. It typically loops, pulling messages with
    {!receive}. *)

val cast : 'msg body -> 'msg Address.t
(** [cast body] spawns a new actor running [body] and returns its address. *)

val send : 'msg Address.t -> 'msg -> unit
(** [send addr msg] delivers [msg] to the actor at [addr]. Messages sent to a
    stopped or finished actor are discarded. *)

val receive : 'msg self -> ?matching:('msg -> bool) -> unit -> 'msg
(** [receive self ()] returns the oldest message in the mailbox, blocking the
    actor until one arrives. [receive self ~matching ()] instead returns the
    oldest message satisfying [matching], leaving the rest queued in order.
    Exceptions raised by [matching] are raised by [receive] without removing
    messages from the mailbox.

    @raise Invalid_argument if [self] belongs to another actor. *)

val address : 'msg self -> 'msg Address.t
(** [address self] is the actor's own address. *)

val await_readable : Unix.file_descr -> unit
(** [await_readable fd] blocks the actor until [fd] is readable. *)

val sleep : float -> unit
(** [sleep seconds] blocks the actor for at least [seconds]. *)

val stop : 'msg Address.t -> unit
(** [stop addr] cancels the actor at [addr]: it never runs again, and any
    descriptor or timer it was blocked on is released so the scheduler can go
    idle. Messages already queued for it are discarded. Stopping a finished actor
    is a no-op; stopping yourself takes effect at your next suspension. *)
