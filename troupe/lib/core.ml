(* Internal shared runtime, deliberately without an .mli: the [cell] type is
   shared by {!Actor} and {!Scheduler}, and the effect constructors below must be
   visible to both the verbs that perform them and the scheduler that matches
   them — while staying hidden from the public API (they are not re-exported by
   {!Troupe}). *)
